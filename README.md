- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**: Enabling efficient data manipulation and analysis

## üß† Machine Learning Models

Our stock prediction engine primarily utilizes:

1. **AutoRegressive (AR) Model**: 
   - A core component of the ARIMA family
   - Implemented via `statsmodels.tsa.ar_model.AutoReg`
   - Utilizes historical price data to forecast future trends

2. **Advanced Time Series Forecasting**:
   - Employs data splitting for training and testing
   - Generates predictions on the test set and projects 90 days into the future

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### System Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bulls-ai.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```
   cd bulls-ai
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run üè†Home.py
   ```
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser

## üìö Usage Guide

1. **Stock Information**: Choose a stock to view detailed company data and key performance indicators
2. **Price Prediction**: Select a stock, time frame, and interval to generate price forecasts
3. **Market Analysis**: Utilize our interactive charts to identify trends and make strategic decisions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

- Our AR model assumes that future prices correlate with historical data, which may not always hold true in volatile markets
- The current model does not account for external factors such as breaking news or macroeconomic shifts
- Stock market prediction is inherently complex and uncertain; use these forecasts as one tool among many in your investment strategy

## üîÆ Roadmap

We're committed to continuous improvement. Future enhancements may include:

- Integration of more sophisticated ARIMA or SARIMA models for nuanced time series analysis
- Incorporation of advanced machine learning algorithms like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Machines
- Implementation of deep learning architectures such as LSTM networks for improved pattern recognition
- Integration of diverse external data sources for more comprehensive market analysis
